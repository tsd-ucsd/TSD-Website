                            The goal of what we want to do as a team is address the housing crisis in San Diego, and show that sustainable and affordable housing is very possible. We expect our structure to be rougly 18ft tall with about 1,000 sqft of living space. We are focusing on creating low-cost housing solutions that are healthy, a joy to inhibit, and are sustainable.

                        <h2>Our Approach</h2>
                        <p>
                            To accomplish this, we are taking a holistic approach by incorporating cutting-edge research on off-gridding, energy efficiency, solar panels, reflective material to combat heat, and incorporating advanced design and manufacturing to keep costs down. Ultimately, we hope our modular prefabricated microunits can be a beneficial addition to communities like Logan Heights in San Diego. We are working with existing community organizations to see what's needed.
